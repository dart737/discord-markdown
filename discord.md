## Additional Information
Of course, this is just the purest basics of starting the server and inviting others. If you're wanting a server for the long term or for a group of people other than those you absolutely trust, you'll need to manage roles and potentially add some plugins if you'd like.

You can find information on this as well as various other features discord has [at their support chat](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/categories/200404378-Server-Setup).
